## How to Use This Content

### For LaTeX Formulas:
- Look for `[MATH: ...]` markers in the enhanced text
- These mark mathematical expressions that were detected
- Original LaTeX commands are preserved within the markers

### For Graphs and Figures:
- Check the images directory for high-resolution PNG files
- Images are named `page_XX.png` where XX is the page number
- These can be viewed or processed further as needed

### For Tables:
- Check the tables directory for structured table data
- Tables are extracted with layout preservation

## Next Steps

1. Review the enhanced text for mathematical content
2. Check extracted images for graphs and figures
3. Use the table data for structured analysis
4. Combine all elements for comprehensive paper analysis
