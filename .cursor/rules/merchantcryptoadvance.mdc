## Goal Tree Methodology

### Schema Definition

The `goal-tree.json` must follow this hierarchical structure:

```json
{
    "main-goal": "Primary objective of the system",
    "sub-goals": [
        {
            "main-goal": "High-level sub-objective",
            "sub-goals": [
                {
                    "main-goal": "Operational sub-goal",
                    "sub-goals": []
                }
